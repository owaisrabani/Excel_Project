Vrinda Store Data Analysis Project:

Welcome to the Vrinda Store Data Analysis Project GitHub repository! 
This project focuses on analyzing customer data to gain insights and improve sales strategies for Vrinda Store.


Project Overview:

In this project, I clean, process, analyze, and create reports and insights using Excel. 
Here are some sample insights derived from the data analysis:

1. Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~65%).
2. Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states (~35%).
3. The adult age group (30-49 yrs) is the maximum contributing (~50%).
4. Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra channels are the maximum contributors (~80%).
   
Conclusion:

Based on the insights obtained, 
the final conclusion to improve Vrinda Store sales is to target women customers of age group (30-49 yrs) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.
This can be achieved by showcasing ads, offers, and coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
